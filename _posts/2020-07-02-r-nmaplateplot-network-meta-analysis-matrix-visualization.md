=> visualize square matrix (name on the diagonal, not symmetric matrix)

The nmaplateplot package is a graphical display of results from network meta-analysis (NMA). It is suitable for outcomes like odds ratio (OR), risk ratio (RR), risk difference (RD) and standardized mean difference (SMD). It also has an option to visually display and compare the surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) of different treatments. Moreover, nmaplateplot is good at details, including choosing colors, text size, circle size, layout and adding title.
