<a href="https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/user-journey">User journeys</a> describe at a high level of detail exactly what steps different users take to complete a specific task within a system, application or website. This technique shows the current (as-is) user workflow, and reveals areas of improvement for the to-be workflow. 

Example 1
